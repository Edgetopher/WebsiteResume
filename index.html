    <h3>Staples, Wilmington DE and Elkton MD</h3>
    <h5>August 2016 - February 2019</h5>
    <p>As of now i relocated from Wilmington store down to Elkton because they needed a Tech Supervisor.  Recently because of my, stellar selling techniques, I was promoted to tech supervisor. I do mostly selling everyday and I pride myself in my selling. I am a salesperson heart. I work with customers in need of assistance with problems on their computer. I also stocked shelves and ran the register. Learned how to communicate to many different types of people and coworkers. Staples is like a family and I enjoy that type of environment.
